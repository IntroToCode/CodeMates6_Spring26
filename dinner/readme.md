### Steps for preparation:

Step 1: Make the marinade: 
Whisk together 0.5 cups soy sauce, grated 0.5 pieces Asian pear or kiwi, grated (the secret tenderizer), 3 tablespoons brown sugar, 3 tablespoons sesame oil, 8 pieces garlic cloves, minced, 1 tablespoons fresh ginger, grated, 2 tablespoons gochugaru (Korean red pepper flakes), and 4 pieces scallions, chopped in a bowl. Taste it. Try not to just drink it.

Step 2: Marinate the meat: Divide the marinade in half. Toss the sliced 1.5 pounds ribeye or sirloin, thinly sliced (bulgogi) in one half and the 2 pounds beef short ribs, flanken-cut (galbi) in the other. Make sure every piece is well coated. Cover and refrigerate — the longer the better.

Step 3: Set up your table: While the meat marinates, set out your spread: 2 pieces butter lettuce or perilla leaves (for wrapping) for wrapping, bowls of 3 cups steamed short-grain rice, 0.3 cups gochujang (Korean chili paste), 2 cups kimchi, extra 4 pieces scallions, chopped, and 2 tablespoons sesame seeds, toasted. This is also when guests realize dinner is going to be interactive and either love you or panic.

Step 4: Cook the bulgogi: Heat a cast iron skillet or grill pan over high heat until screaming hot. Cook the 1.5 pounds ribeye or sirloin, thinly sliced (bulgogi) in batches — don't crowd the pan or it'll steam instead of sear. About 2 minutes 
02:00 per side. The sugars in the marinade will caramelize fast, so watch it closely.

Step 5: Cook the galbi: Same high heat, same principle. The 2 pounds beef short ribs, flanken-cut (galbi) are thicker so give them about 4 minutes 04:00 per side until charred at the edges and cooked through. Try to resist eating them straight off the pan. You will fail.

Step 6: Assemble & eat: Take a 2 pieces butter lettuce or perilla leaves (for wrapping) leaf, add a spoonful of 3 cups steamed short-grain rice, a piece of meat, a dab of 0.3 cups gochujang (Korean chili paste), a pinch of 2 tablespoons sesame seeds, toasted, and some 2 cups kimchi. Fold it up and eat the whole thing in one bite like a civilized person, or take a modest bite and have the whole thing fall apart like the rest of us.

### Notes:

Make-ahead magic: Marinate overnight for best results — the pear/kiwi enzymes break down the meat and make it incredibly tender. Don't marinate longer than 24 hours or the texture gets mushy.

No tabletop grill? No problem. A cast iron skillet on high heat gives you great char. Open a window — things will get smoky and your smoke alarm may try to join the party.

Vegetarian guests? Marinate thick slices of king oyster mushrooms or tofu in the same sauce. Works beautifully.

Drink pairing: Korean beer (Hite or Cass), soju mixed with beer (called "somaek"), or just sparkling water if you want to remember the evening.
